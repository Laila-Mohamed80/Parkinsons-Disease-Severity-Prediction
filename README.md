# Parkinsons-Disease-Severity-Prediction

**Team Project – Machine Learning | Regression & Classification | Feature Engineering**  
**Duration:** 04/2025 – 05/2025

---

## Project Overview
Developed machine learning models to **predict Parkinson’s disease progression (UPDRS score)** and classify disease presence. The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and interpretation.

---

## Features
- Performed **data preprocessing, feature engineering**, and categorical encoding.  
- Applied **statistical feature selection** (ANOVA, Point-biserial) to identify top predictors.  
- Optimized multiple models (**Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting**) via hyperparameter tuning.  
- Achieved **95% classification accuracy** with Gradient Boosting.  

---

## Technologies
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib/seaborn  
- **ML Techniques:** Regression, Classification, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning
